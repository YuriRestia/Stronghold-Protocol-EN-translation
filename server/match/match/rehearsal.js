// server/match/match/rehearsal.js — Match methods: the bot layout rehearsal delegated to the current host's browser
// (DESIGN §14; Match option `botRehearsalDelegate`; (fork) on by default, env SP_BOT_REHEARSAL_HOST=0 turns it off). A rehearsal is a real
// simulation of this round's wave against each candidate layout, 0.2–1 s of CPU per bot prep — the one part of a bot's
// play that needs no match state, so the host's browser can do it off the page's main thread instead of the server.
// Only an AI teammate's prep is offered (`ps.isBot`): a human seat played by "AI 托管" uses the same bot routine, but
// the server keeps rehearsing it as before.
//
// The server sends the candidate BattleSpecs it would simulate itself, the seed and the tick cap in one `b.rehearsal`
// frame; the host's Worker simulates them with the same sim and the same scoring (server/sim/rehearsal.js) and answers
// `b.rehearsalResult { taskId, choice }` — the index of its pick in the order it was sent. Nothing else travels: the
// candidate layouts, the scoring and the layout application stay on the server, so the answer can only name one of the
// server's own candidates. The server takes the pick as it is (the host's browser is a worker of the match, like the
// authoritative client of a field): it does not re-simulate to prove the pick, which would spend exactly the CPU the
// delegation saves.
//
// A task is live only while its bot prep runs and its executor is still the host. A timeout, a host that changed,
// disconnected or left, and an errored or invalid answer make the server run the very same candidates itself
// (`job.takeOver()`), and the task is dropped, so a late or repeated answer is ignored — never applied twice. A task
// the server stops waiting for is also cancelled on the host (`b.rehearsalCancel`), which drops the work there
// instead of letting a stale simulation hold the browser's Worker. Waiting never extends the prep: MatchPrep.endPrep
// cancels whatever is left (Match._cancelRehearsal), and the deadline stays the phase's own.
// Installed on Match.prototype by server/match/Match.js (a method container: never instantiated; `this` is the match).
