# Fork changelog (dev-0.2)

Changes made in this fork ([YuriRestia/Stronghold-Protocol-EN-translation](https://github.com/YuriRestia/Stronghold-Protocol-EN-translation))
on top of the upstream game ([sganggs/Stronghold-Protocol](https://github.com/sganggs/Stronghold-Protocol)). Upstream's
own changes aren't repeated here; each upstream merge links the upstream commit it brought in, and
[CHANGELOG.en.md](CHANGELOG.en.md) covers what that release contains. Newest first.

## 2026-10-11

### Upstream merge

- Merged upstream 0.2.4 at [`bc50cac0`](https://github.com/sganggs/Stronghold-Protocol/commit/bc50cac01ff447eff3ab6c35f69d934bbc23b48f) (`7bd9c272`).
  Upstream's per-Operator voice dropdown (its DIY picker import, `.lo-voice` CSS and 3 pack strings, touched by 0.2.4)
  stayed out, so the fork keeps its single voice language system. The matchmaking design section moved from §29 to
  §90 (upstream's 0.2.4 history took §29); §90 and up are reserved for fork sections, and the no-gap check in
  `test/docs-paths.test.js` skips them.

### Changes

- Zero-downtime restarts ("generations"). Each deploy (`scripts/generations.mjs deploy`) starts a new server process
  next to the old one, behind a small router (`scripts/router.mjs`) that Caddy talks to. New visitors go to the new
  generation, and running matches finish on the old one. Old pages get `sys.retire` and move over once no match is on
  screen; a room still waiting is lost. An old generation is stopped when its last human match ends, or after one hour.
  The client builds its URLs through `public/js/gen.js`. Without the router (local play, LAN, tests) nothing changes.
- Fixed: a freshly deployed generation retired itself at startup (the table still named the old one as current),
  so lobby pages reloaded in a loop. A generation now retires only once the table lists it, and `deploy` refuses
  to switch to one that came up retired.
- Lobby announcement banner updated for 0.2.4 (shown again to everyone who closed the 0.2.2 one).

## 2026-10-10

### Upstream merge

- Merged upstream 0.2.3 at [`1db8e510`](https://github.com/sganggs/Stronghold-Protocol/commit/1db8e51023ae6abaec9370beb81a513d5c4d0b01) (`f81c8602`).
  Upstream's per-Operator voice overrides were removed so the fork keeps a single voice language system (the voice
  language picker below).

### Contributions

- English translations of README, CHANGELOG, NOTICE and the DEPLOY, PLAYING and WINDOWS guides
  ([PR #3](https://github.com/YuriRestia/Stronghold-Protocol-EN-translation/pull/3), thanks to @evenifyouforget). Kept in
  sync with the Chinese originals from now on, which stay authoritative. The English README lives at
  [.github/README.md](.github/README.md), so GitHub shows it on the repo page; the Chinese README.md stays at the root.
- Lobby "Difficulty Details" dialog: what each difficulty actually changes, side by side for Solo and Team Simulation
  (enemy HP/ATK multipliers per round, Leader HP per Leader, Alliance bans, map pool, Improv rounds, Hidden Core entry,
  battle time limits), read from the same data the match uses
  ([PR #4](https://github.com/YuriRestia/Stronghold-Protocol-EN-translation/pull/4), thanks to @evenifyouforget).

### Changes

- Damage chart: a chart button next to Chat (lower left) opens a bar chart of each of your Operators' damage, live
  during combat and the previous round's during the Rest Phase, with the round total. Copies of the same Operator (and
  its elite form) share one bar, and summons count for their summoner. The result screen adds a match chart under the
  player cards, with each bar split into its rounds. Only your own Operators are shown, since the numbers come from the
  battle your browser runs. They're kept in memory, so a page reload mid-match starts the chart over.
- Briefing: click a core Alliance to tell your teammates which Alliance you're going for; the call shows on the Alliance
  disc, and two players calling the same one are flagged as a conflict (`g.bondCall`). The hint now sits on the Core
  Alliances heading, right after the "Core Bonds" label, as a glowing mint chip ("Click an alliance to call your plan")
  instead of small grey text above the discs; the Core Alliances panel has more room around it.
- Briefing: hovering an alliance with banned operators opens a second box beside its tooltip listing them, each with
  avatar, name and alliances (the hovered one in mint). The shared `Tooltip` gained an optional `aside` for this.
- Briefing: the setup reroll banner is now a single "Reroll stage setup" button at the lower left of the footer; during
  a vote it shows the count and the Agree / Reject / Cancel buttons there, with the explanation and who agreed in the
  tooltip.
- Co-op briefing timer raised from the official 25 s to 45 s, so the team has time to agree on core Alliances (solo
  stays untimed).
- Ready / unready sounds, and a low-timer sound on the Strategy select screen.
- Lobby header redesign; the "Add to Home Screen" button moved into the lobby.
- In-game news updated for 0.2.2.

## 2026-10-09

### Upstream merge

- Merged upstream 0.2.2 at [`62eb1134`](https://github.com/sganggs/Stronghold-Protocol/commit/62eb113419123d9a3a63606107bbf85230c5dd2f) (`60745dd1`).

### Changes

- About server panel on the title screen with the server's contact points.
- Asset preloading: start, pause / resume and finish downloading the game's assets ahead of time; they're used until
  Clear Cache. Based on [xinhai-ai/Stronghold-Protocol](https://github.com/xinhai-ai/Stronghold-Protocol), thanks to
  @xinhai-ai.
- English is the default interface language; voices fall back English → Japanese → Chinese.
- The voice selector shows language names in the current interface language, with a toggle for the native-language dub
  where one exists; the implementation was brought closer to upstream's.
- The three performance benchmarks moved out of `npm test` into `npm run test:perf`.

## 2026-10-08

- Solo queue matchmaker: players searching alone are grouped into rooms automatically.
